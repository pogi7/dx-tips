## Get a Designer

Dev teams will sometime have people wear multiple hats while doing development.  One of these hats is designer.  It is highly recommended to get a designer who is trained and knows what they're doing instead of wearing multiple hats. 

### Where to Find One

Professional Project: 
- Ask your supervisor if there is a design team in your organization

## Listen to Your Designer

It's always a good idea to listen to your designer.  A lot of research goes into making a good user experience.  Information is usually conveyed in a Figma diagram.  

### Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com) is the industry standard app for designers to make designs for websites, mobile, watches, etc. and share those with others.  For a dev team, this design is usually what inspires the look and feel of the frontend.

Figma can also be used to verify that your app meets accessibility requirements such as ensuring that the app's colors works for people with color blindness.
