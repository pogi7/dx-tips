# User Experience

Spending some time to think about the user experience of the app will help improve DX pleasantness and effectiveness.

User experience is something for the design team to be thinking about but having a general knowledge of it will be important to improve DX.

### What is it? 
For digital transformation, [user experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/) includes all end user's interactions with a service, app, or piece of software. 

### Why should I care? 
A [good user experience](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/the-value-of-ux-design/) is generally easy and enjoyable, while a bad user experience is complicated, confusing and frustrating.  Bad user experience may lead to an increase in code refactors.  This may lead to burn out of the development team.

### How to Implement? 
1. Get a Designer: Dev teams will sometime have people wear multiple hats while doing development.  One of these hats is designer.  It is highly recommended to get a designer who is trained and knows what they're doing instead of wearing multiple hats.
2. Listen to Your Designer: It's always a good idea to listen to your designer.  A lot of research goes into making a good user experience.  Information is usually conveyed in a Figma diagram, survey information, or PowerPoint presentation.
3. [Figma](https://www.figma.com) is an app commonly used by designers to make designs for the web, mobile, watches, etc. and share those with others.  For a dev team, this design is usually what inspires the look and feel of the frontend.

While accessibility is a different concept than user experience, the two topics are related.  Figma can also be used to verify that your app meets accessibility requirements like the ones outlined in [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).  Some accessibility concerns can be ensuring that the app's colors comply to requirements for people with color blindness.
