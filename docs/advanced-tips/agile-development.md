# Agile Development

Adopting an agile way of thinking within a dev team is an important way to improve the pleasantness and effectiveness of a team's DX.

Agile development is a way of thinking.  It's a culture that a team should adopt.  Agile is usually used in processes that can improved iteratively and where order of operations isn't extremely important.  Agile is usually not used to its fullest in industries that need to be risk adverse such as healthcare or space exploration.

## DevSecOps

### What is it? 
[DevSecOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops) or Development, Security, and Operations is a way of implementing agile by having the dev team be responsible for the development, security, and operations of the app instead of passing those responsibilities off to other dev teams. 

### Why should I care? 
[DevSecOps](https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/devsecops/it-industries-adopt-devsecops/) leads to faster delivery times during the software development lifecycle without deprioritizing security, repeatable and standarized software processes, and save costs by reducing errors and refactoring through automating repetitive tasks. 

### How to Implement? 
1. [CICD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd): Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment is way to achieve DevSecOps by having the dev team continuously integrate new changes to the app and continuously deploying these changes to the app.  This is commonly used to automatically build and test an app to ensure that the app functions as intended and verify that there is high code quality.

## Scrum

### What is it? 
[Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) is one way that Agile can be achieved where there is a fixed increment of when to do work (i.e 2 weeks, 1 month, etc.).  There are required roles such as scrum master or product owner in order to implement scrum.

### Why should I care? 
Scrum standardizes development processses since it is designed to deliver value in fixed increments.

### How to Implement? 
1. Scrum boards and ticket system: According to [Stack Overflow's 2022 insights](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022#section-most-popular-technologies-asynchronous-tools), the most widely used ticket system by personal and professional developers for scrum is [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

## Kanban

### What is it? 
[Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) is another way that Agile can be achieved where there is no fixed increment of when to do work (i.e 2 weeks, 1 month, etc.).  There are no required roles such as scrum master or product owner in order to implement Kanban but a board is required for Kanban to be fully achieved.

### Why should I care? 
Kanban is less rigid than scrum allowing the development team to adapt to changes faster.  This can help prevent developer burnout as the development team can be more flexible to changing needs.

### How to Implement? 
1. Kanban boards and ticket system: According to [Stack Overflow's 2022 insights](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022#section-most-popular-technologies-asynchronous-tools), the most widely used ticket system by personal and professional developers for kanban is [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
