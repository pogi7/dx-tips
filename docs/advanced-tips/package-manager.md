# Package Managers

Package managers are an important way to improve the pleasantness and effectiveness of DX.

All package managers are used to add, remove, modify, upgrade, and maintain software.

## OS Level

For most developers an OS (operating system) level package manager will be the most important package manager to use.  These package managers install software into a common folder on a computer making managing software much easier.

### Windows

By default, Windows does not come with a package manager.  

The two most common Windows package managers are:
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

### macOS

By default, macOS does not come with a package manager.  

The most common macOS package manager is:
- [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)

According to [Stack Overflow's 2022 insights](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022#section-most-popular-technologies-other-tools), homebrew is the most widely used OS level package manager.

### Linux

By default, Linux comes with a package manager.

Each distro of Linux comes with a unique package manager but here are the most common:
- [DNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_(software))
- [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software))

## Programming Language Level

Most programming languages have package managers.  These package managers are used to get libraries or dependencies from open source repositories that have been published to the registry of the package managers.

Most programming languages have a package manager but here are some for the most popular programming languages:
- [pyPI](https://pypi.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## App Level

Some large scale apps have package managers as well.  This helps since a developer does not need to recreate functionality if it already on the app's package manager registry.

An example of an app having a package manager is Kubernetes's [Helm](https://helm.sh)
