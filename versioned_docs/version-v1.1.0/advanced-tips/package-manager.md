# Package Managers

Package managers are an important way to improve the pleasantness and effectiveness of DX.

### What is it? 
Package managers add, remove, modify, upgrade, and maintain software.  There are package managers at the OS, programming language, or app level.

### Why should I care? 
Package managers standarize how 3rd party dependencies and software can be maintained throughout the lifecycle of an app.  This standardization leads to quicker onboarding, higher success of knowledge transfer, and less user-error bugs.

### How to Implement? 
1. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) Windows Package Manager
2. [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) macOS Package Manager
3. [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) Linux Debian Package Manager
4. [pyPI](https://pypi.org/) Python Package Manager
5. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) Javascript Package Manager
6. [Helm](https://helm.sh) Kubernetes Package Manager
